This repo is an implementation of a **context-aware** AI Agent for Sales using LLMs and can work across voice, email and texting (SMS, WhatsApp, WeChat, Weibo, Telegram, etc.). 

SalesGPT is *context-aware*, which means it can understand what stage of a sales conversation it is in and act accordingly.
Morever, SalesGPT has access to tools, such as your own pre-defined product knowledge base, significantly reducing hallucinations.

# Our Vision: Build the Best Open Source AI Sales Agent

We are building SalesGPT to power your best AI Sales Agents. Hence, we would love to learn more about use cases you are building towards which will fuel SalesGPT development roadmap, so please don't hesitate to reach out.

# Features

### Contextual Understanding: Sales Stage Awareness

The AI Sales Agent understands the conversation stage (you can define your own stages fitting your needs):

  - Introduction: Start the conversation by introducing yourself and your company. 
  - Qualification: Qualify the prospect by confirming if they are the right person to talk to regarding your product/service.
  - Value Proposition: Briefly explain how your product/service can benefit the prospect. 
  - Needs Analysis: Ask open-ended questions to uncover the prospect's needs and pain points. 
  - Solution Presentation: Based on the prospect's needs, present your product/service as the solution that can address their pain points.
  - Objection Handling: Address any objections that the prospect may have regarding your product/service. 
  - Close: Ask for the sale by proposing a next step. 
  - End Conversation: The user does not want to continue the conversation, so end the call.

### Business & Product Knowledge:
-  Reference only your business information & products and significantly reduce hallucinations!

### Use Any LLM to Power Your AI Sales Agent
- Thanks to our integration with [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm), you can choose *any closed/open-sourced LLM* to work with SalesGPT! Thanks to LiteLLM maintainers for this contribution!

### Power Real-time Sales Conversations
- Synchronous & Asynchronous Completion with LLMs
- Synchronous & Asynchronous Streaming from LLMs

### Optimized for Low Latency in Voice Channel
- Voice AI Sales Agent boasts **<1s** round trip response rate to human speakers which includes the entire pipeline - speech to text, LLM inference, and text to speech - while ensuring stability and scalability.

### Human in the loop
- For use cases where AI sales agent needs human supervision.

### Langsmith tracing
- debug, test, evaluate, and monitor chains and intelligent agents built on any LLM framework

### Enterprise-Grade Security

- Upcoming integration with [PromptArmor](https://promptarmor.com/) to protect your AI Sales Agents against security vulnerabilities (see our roadmap).

# Setup

## Install

Make sure you have a **python >=3.8,<3.12**:

Create a virtual environment at a location on your computer. We use the generic "env" name for our virtual environment in the setup. You can rename this, but make sure to then use this name later when working with the environment (also rename the VENV variable in the Makefile accordingly to be able to use make commands successfully after cloning our repository):

#### For Windows:

- Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
- Navigate to your project directory: `cd path\to\your\project`
- Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv env`
- Activate the virtual environment: `.\env\Scripts\activate`

#### For Mac:

- Open Terminal.
- Navigate to your project directory: `cd path/to/your/project`
- Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv env`
- Activate the virtual environment: `source env/bin/activate`

To deactivate a virtual environment after you have stopped using it simply run: `deactivate`

Clone the SalesGPT Github repository: 

`git clone https://github.com/filip-michalsky/SalesGPT.git`

Navigate to the repository and in case you used a different venv name rename the VENV variable in the Makefile: 

`cd SalesGPT`



If you simply want to work with SalesGPT as an end user without local changes you can install from PyPI using: 

`pip install salesgpt`

If you want to work on your own version of SalesGPT or contribute to our open-source version install by activating your virtual environment as aforementioned and then run: 

`make setup`

For more detailed installation steps along with the reasons for doing each please visit CONTRIBUTING.md

Finally, for use of SalesGPT create an `.env` file just as our `.env.example` and put your API keys there by specifying a new line just as we have done.

## Run an Example AI Sales agent
If you used a local installation of SalesGPT skip the next two steps and directly run the run.py script: 

`git clone https://github.com/filip-michalsky/SalesGPT.git`

`cd SalesGPT`

`python run.py --verbose True --config examples/example_agent_setup.json`

from your terminal.

## Test your setup

1. Activate your environment as described above. (run `source env/bin/activate` on Unix-like systems and `.\env\Scripts\activate` on Windows. Replace *env* with the name of your virtual environment)
2. cd `SalesGPT`      If you haven't already navigated to the SalesGPT home directory
3. `make test`

All tests should pass. Warnings can be ignored.

## Uninstall SalesGPT

To delete the virtual environment you used for SalesGPT programming and your SalesGPT repository from your system navigate to the directory where you installed your virtual environment and cloned SalesGPT and run: 
`make clean`

## Deploy

We have a SalesGPT deployment demo via FastAPI.

Please refer to [README-api.md](https://github.com/filip-michalsky/SalesGPT/blob/main/README-api.md) for instructions!

# Documentation

We leverage the [`langchain`](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) library in this implementation, specifically [Custom Agent Configuration](https://langchain-langchain.vercel.app/docs/modules/agents/how_to/custom_agent_with_tool_retrieval) and are inspired by [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) architecture.

## LangSmith tracing

LangSmith is a platform for building production-grade LLM applications.

It lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor chains and intelligent agents built on any LLM framework and seamlessly integrates with LangChain, the go-to open source framework for building with LLMs.

LangSmith is developed by LangChain, the company behind the open source LangChain framework.

To switch on the LangSmith tracing you have to do the following steps:

1. [Create a LangSmith account](https://smith.langchain.com/)
2. [Create an API key in settings](https://smith.langchain.com/settings)
3. Add you API key and Project name from LangSmith account to .env file or run.py module
4. Switch on the "LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2" setting in run.py to "true"
5. That's it. You'll get better understanding of your agents and chaing performance in LangChain admin panel. 

For futher reading take a look at the [docs](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/)
