# SalesGPT

This notebook demonstrates an implementation of a **context-aware** Sales AI agent using LLMs.

It demonstrates how we can use AI to automate sales development representatives activites, such as outbound sales calls. 

SalesGPT can understand what section of a sales conversation is it in: 
    - Introduction
    - Qualification
    - Objection handling
    - etc.

and acts accordingly.

We leverage the LangChain library in this implementation and are inspired by BabyAGI [Link].

To get a feel for a conversation with the AI Sales agent, you can run:

`python automate_sales.py`

from your terminal.

make sure you environment is using Python 3.10+ and `requirements.txt` are installed.
